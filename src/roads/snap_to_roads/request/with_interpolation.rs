impl crate::roads::snap_to_roads::Request<'_> {
    /// Whether to interpolate a path to include all points forming the full
    /// road-geometry.
    ///
    /// ## Arguments
    ///
    /// * `interpolate` â€§ When `true`, additional interpolated points will also
    ///   be returned, resulting in a path that smoothly follows the geometry of
    ///   the road, even around corners and through tunnels. Interpolated paths
    ///   will most likely contain more points than the original path. Defaults
    ///   to `false`.
    ///
    /// ## Example
    ///
    /// * Turn on interpolation:
    /// ```rust
    /// .with_interpolation(true)
    /// ```

        self.interpolate = Some(interpolate.into());
        // Return modified Request struct to caller.
