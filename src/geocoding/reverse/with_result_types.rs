impl crate::geocoding::ReverseRequest<'_> {
    /// Restricts the results from the geocoder to the specified result type(s).
    ///
    /// # Arguments:
    ///
    /// * `result_type` - A single result type filter.
    ///
    /// # Description:
    ///
    /// A filter of one or more result types. If the parameter contains multiple
    /// result types, the API returns all addresses that match any of the types.
    /// A note about processing: The `result_type` parameter does not _restrict_
    /// the search to the specified location type(s). Rather, the `result_type`
    /// acts as a post-search filter: the API fetches all results for the
    /// specified `latlng`, then discards those results that do not match the
    /// specified result type(s). The following values are supported:
    ///
    /// * `PlaceType::StreetAddress` indicates a precise street address.
    ///
    /// * `PlaceType::Route` indicates a named route (such as "US 101").
    ///
    /// * `PlaceType::Intersection` indicates a major intersection, usually of
    ///   two major roads.
    ///
    /// * `PlaceType::Political` indicates a political entity. Usually, this
    ///   type indicates a polygon of some civil administration.
    ///
    /// * `PlaceType::Country` indicates the national political entity, and is
    ///   typically the highest order type returned by the Geocoder.
    ///
    /// * `PlaceType::AdministrativeAreaLevel1` indicates a first-order civil
    ///   entity below the country level. Within the United States, these
    ///   administrative levels are states. Not all nations exhibit these
    ///   administrative levels. In most cases,
    ///   `PlaceType::AdministrativeAreaLevel1` short names will closely match
    ///   ISO 3166-2 subdivisions and other widely circulated lists; however
    ///   this is not guaranteed as our geocoding results are based on a variety
    ///   OF signals and location data.
    ///
    /// * `PlaceType::AdministrativeAreaLevel2` indicates a second-order civil
    ///   entity below the country level. Within the United States, these
    ///   administrative levels are counties. Not all nations exhibit these
    ///   administrative levels.
    ///
    /// * `PlaceType::AdministrativeAreaLevel3` indicates a third-order civil
    ///   entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil
    ///   division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
    ///
    /// * `PlaceType::AdministrativeAreaLevel4` indicates a fourth-order civil
    ///   entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil
    ///   division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
    ///
    /// * `PlaceType::AdministrativeAreaLevel5` indicates a fifth-order civil
    ///   entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil
    ///   division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
    ///
    /// * `PlaceType::ColloquialArea` indicates a commonly-used alternative name
    ///   for the entity.
    ///
    /// * `PlaceType::Locality` indicates an incorporated city or town political
    ///   entity.
    ///
    /// * `PlaceType::Sublocality` indicates a first-order civil entity below a
    ///   locality. For some locations may receive one of the additional types:
    ///   `PlaceType::SublocalityLevel1` to `PlaceType::SublocalityLevel5`. Each
    ///   sublocality level is a civil entity. Larger numbers indicate a smaller
    ///   geographic area.
    ///
    /// * `PlaceType::Neighborhood` indicates a named neighborhood.
    ///
    /// * `PlaceType::Premise` indicates a named location, usually a building or
    ///   collection of buildings with a common name.
    ///
    /// * `PlaceType::Subpremise` indicates a first-order entity below a named
    ///   location, usually a singular building within a collection of buildings
    ///   with a common name.
    ///
    /// * `PlaceType::PostalCode` indicates a postal code as used to address
    ///   postal mail within the country.
    ///
    /// * `PlaceType::NaturalFeature` indicates a prominent natural feature.
    ///
    /// * `PlaceType::Airport` indicates an airport.
    ///
    /// * `PlaceType::Park` indicates a named park.
    ///
    /// * `PlaceType::PointOfInterest` indicates a named point of interest.
    ///   Typically, these "POI"s are prominent local entities that don't easily
    ///   fit in another category, such as "Empire State Building" or "Eiffel
    ///   Tower".
    ///
    /// If both `result_type` and `location_type` filters are present then the
    /// API returns only those results that match both the `result_type` and the
    /// `location_type values`. If none of the filter values are acceptable, the
    /// API returns `ZERO_RESULTS`.
    ///
    /// # Examples:
    ///
    /// * A single result type filter. This example restricts results to the
    ///   neighbourhood:
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// .with_result_type(PlaceType::Neighborhood)
    /// ```
    ///
    /// * Multiple component filters may be stacked together. This example
    ///   restricts results to a neighborhood and a locality:
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// .with_result_type(PlaceType::Neighborhood)
    /// .with_result_type(PlaceType::Locality)
    /// ```

    /// * Alternatively, multiple result type filters may be passed in a single

    /// type.
