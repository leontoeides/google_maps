    ///
    /// * `location` ‧ The point around which to retrieve place information.
    ///   Note: When using the Text Search API, the `location` parameter may be
    ///   overriden if the `query` contains an explicit location such as `Market
    ///   in Barcelona`.
    ///
    /// * `radius` ‧ Defines the distance (in meters) within which to return
    ///   place results. You may bias results to a specified circle by passing a
    ///   `location` and a `radius` parameter. Doing so instructs the Places
    ///   service to prefer showing results within that circle; results outside of
    ///   the defined area may still be displayed.
    ///
    /// The radius will automatically be clamped to a maximum value depending on
    /// the type of search and other parameters.
    ///
    /// * Autocomplete: 50,000 meters
    /// * Nearby Search:
    ///     * with `keyword` or `name`: 50,000 meters
    ///     * without `keyword` or `name`
    ///         * Up to 50,000 meters, adjusted dynamically based on area
    ///           density, independent of `rankby` parameter.
    ///         * When using `rankby=distance`, the radius parameter will not be
    ///           accepted, and will result in an `INVALID_REQUEST`.
    /// * Query Autocomplete: 50,000 meters
    /// * Text Search: 50,000 meters
