//! The **Places API** is a service that returns information about places.
//! Places are defined within this API as establishments, geographic locations,
//! or prominent points of interest.
//!
//! ## Before you begin
//!
//! * **Before you begin**: Before you start using the Places API, you need a
//!   project with a billing account and the Places API enabled. We recommend
//!   creating multiple Project Owners and Billing Administrators, so that
//!   you'll always have someone with these roles available to your team. To
//!   learn more, see [Set up in Cloud
//!   Console](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/cloud-setup).
//!
//! ## Note: Server-side and client-side libraries
//!
//! * The Places API is also available with the [Java Client, Python Client, Go
//!   Client and Node.js Client for Google Maps Services](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/client-library).
//!   The Places API and the client libraries are for use in server applications.
//!
//! * If you're building a client-side application, take a look at the [Places
//!   SDK for Android](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk),
//!   the [Places SDK for iOS](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk),
//!   and the [Places Library, Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places).
//!
//! # [Introducing the API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview#Introduction)
//!
//! The following place requests are available:
//!
//! * [Place Search](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/search)
//!   **(Not yet implemented in this client.)**
//!   returns a list of places based on a user's location or searchstring.
//!
//! * [Place Details](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/details)
//!   **(Not yet implemented in this client.)**
//!   returns more detailed information about a specific place, including user
//!   reviews.
//!
//! * [Place Photos](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/photos)
//!   **(Not yet implemented in this client.)**
//!   provides access to the millions of place-related photos stored in Google's
//!   Place database.
//!
//! * [Place Autocomplete](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/autocomplete)
//!   automatically fills in the name and/or address of a place as users type.
//!
//! * [Query Autocomplete](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/query)
//!   provides a query prediction service for text-based geographic searches,
//!   returning suggested queries as users type.
//!
//! The Places API uses a place ID to uniquely identify a place. For details
//! about the format and usage of this identifier across the Places API and
//! other APIs, see the [Place IDs](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-id)
//! documentation.
//!
//! # [Policies and Terms](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview#Requirements)
//!
//! All applications that use the Places API or Place Autocomplete service must
//! adhere to the requirements described in the [Places API
//! Policies](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/policies#terms_of_use_and_privacy_policy_requirements)
//! and the [Google Maps Platform Terms of
//! Service](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms).
//! The Places API and Google Place Autocomplete share the usage quota as
//! described in the [Places API Usage and
//! Billing](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/usage)
//! documentation.
//!
//! For quota and pricing information for the Places API and Place Autocomplete
//! service, see the [Places API Usage and
//! Billing](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/usage-and-billing)
//! documentation.
