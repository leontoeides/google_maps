    client: &'a crate::client::Client,

    /// The point around which to retrieve place information. This must be

    location: crate::types::LatLng,

    /// Defines the distance (in meters) within which to return place results.
    /// You may bias results to a specified circle by passing a `location` and a
    /// `radius` parameter. Doing so instructs the Places service to prefer
    /// showing results within that circle; results outside of the defined area
    /// may still be displayed.
    ///
    /// The radius will automatically be clamped to a maximum value depending on
    /// the type of search and other parameters.
    ///
    /// * Autocomplete: 50,000 meters
    /// * Nearby Search:
    ///     * with `keyword` or `name`: 50,000 meters
    ///     * without `keyword` or `name`
    ///         * Up to 50,000 meters, adjusted dynamically based on area
    ///           density, independent of `rankby` parameter.
    ///         * When using `rankby=distance`, the radius parameter will not be
    ///           accepted, and will result in an `INVALID_REQUEST`.
    /// * Query Autocomplete: 50,000 meters
    /// * Nearby Search: 50,000 meters
    radius: u32,

    // Optional parameters:
    // --------------------
    /// The text string on which to search, for example: "restaurant" or "123
    /// Main Street". This must be a place name, address, or category of
    /// establishments. Any other types of input can generate errors and are not
    /// guaranteed to return valid results. The Google Places service will
    /// return candidate matches based on this string and order the results
    /// based on their perceived relevance.
    ///
    /// Explicitly including location information using this parameter may
    /// conflict with the location, radius, and rankby parameters, causing
    /// unexpected results.
    ///
    /// If this parameter is omitted, places with a `business_status` of
    /// `CLOSED_TEMPORARILY` or `CLOSED_PERMANENTLY` will not be returned.
    keyword: Option<String>,

    /// The language in which to return results.
    ///
    /// * See the list of supported languages. Google often updates the
    ///   supported languages, so this list may not be exhaustive.
    ///
    /// * If `language` is not supplied, the API attempts to use the preferred
    ///   language as specified in the `Accept-Language` header.
    ///
    /// * The API does its best to provide a street address that is readable for
    ///   both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street
    ///   addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable
    ///   by the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other
    ///   addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components
    ///   are all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first
    ///   component.
    ///
    /// * If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the
    ///   closest match.
    ///
    /// * The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results
    ///   that the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are
    ///   returned. The geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending
    ///   on language, such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms
    ///   that may be valid in one language but not in another. For example,
    ///   _utca_ and _tér_ are synonyms for street in Hungarian.
    language: Option<crate::types::Language>,

    /// Restricts results to only those places within the specified range. Valid
    /// values range between 0 (most affordable) to 4 (most expensive),

    /// your query.
    opennow: Option<bool>,

    /// Returns up to 20 results from a previously run search. Setting a
    /// pagetoken parameter will execute a search with the same parameters used
    /// previously — all parameters other than pagetoken will be ignored.
    pagetoken: Option<String>,

    /// Specifies the order in which results are listed. Possible values are:
    ///
    /// * `prominence` (default). This option sorts results based on their
    ///   importance. Ranking will favor prominent places within the set radius
    ///   over nearby places that match but that are less prominent. Prominence
    ///   can be affected by a place's ranking in Google's index, global
    ///   popularity, and other factors. When prominence is specified, the
    ///   `radius` parameter is required.
    ///
    /// * `distance`. This option biases search results in ascending order by
    ///   their distance from the specified location. When `distance` is
    ///   specified, one or more of `keyword`, `name`, or `type` is required and
    ///   radius is disallowed.
    rankby: Option<crate::places::RankBy>,

    /// Restricts the results to places matching the specified type. Only one
    /// type may be specified. If more than one type is provided, all types
    /// following the first entry are ignored.

    ///
    /// See the list of [supported types](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types).

    /// * Note: Adding both `keyword` and `type` with the same value

    ///   `ZERO_RESULTS`.
