    /// ## Arguments
    ///
    /// * `keyword` â€§ The text string on which to search, for example:
    ///   "restaurant" or "123 Main Street". This must be a place name, address,
    ///   or category of establishments. Any other types of input can generate
    ///   errors and are not guaranteed to return valid results. The Google
    ///   Places service will return candidate matches based on this string and
    ///   order the results based on their perceived relevance.
    ///
    /// Explicitly including location information using this parameter may
    /// conflict with the location, radius, and rankby parameters, causing
    /// unexpected results.
    ///
    /// If this parameter is omitted, places with a `business_status` of
    /// `CLOSED_TEMPORARILY` or `CLOSED_PERMANENTLY` will not be returned.
