    //
    /// Initializes the builder pattern for a Places API _Text Search_ query
    /// with the required, non-optional parameters.
    ///
    /// ## Arguments
    ///
    /// * `client` ‧ Your application's Google Maps API client struct.
    ///
    /// * `query` ‧ The text string on which to search, for example:
    ///   "restaurant" or "123 Main Street". This must a place name, address, or
    ///   category of establishments. Any other types of input can generate
    ///   errors and are not guaranteed to return valid results. The Google
    ///   Places service will return candidate matches based on this string and
    ///   order the results based on their perceived relevance.
    ///
    /// * `radius` ‧ Defines the distance (in meters) within which to return
    ///   place results. You may bias results to a specified circle by passing a
    ///   `location` and a `radius` parameter. Doing so instructs the Places
    ///   service to prefer showing results within that circle; results outside
    ///   of the defined area may still be displayed.
    ///
    /// The radius will automatically be clamped to a maximum value depending on
    /// the type of search and other parameters.
    ///
    /// * Autocomplete: 50,000 meters
    /// * Nearby Search:
    ///     * with `keyword` or `name`: 50,000 meters
    ///     * without `keyword` or `name`
    ///         * Up to 50,000 meters, adjusted dynamically based on area
    ///           density, independent of `rankby` parameter.
    ///         * When using `rankby=distance`, the radius parameter will not be
    ///           accepted, and will result in an `INVALID_REQUEST`.
    /// * Query Autocomplete: 50,000 meters
    /// * Nearby Search: 50,000 meters
