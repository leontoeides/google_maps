impl crate::places::place_details::Request<'_> {
    /// Sets the requested fields to the Places API _Place Details_ query.
    ///
    /// ## Arguments
    ///
    /// * `fields` â€§ Use the fields parameter to specify a comma-separated list
    ///   of place data types to return. For example:
    ///   `fields=formatted_address,name,geometry`. Use a forward slash when
    ///   specifying compound values. For example: `opening_hours/open_now`.
    ///
    /// Fields are divided into three billing categories: Basic, Contact, and
    /// Atmosphere. Basic fields are billed at base rate, and incur no
    /// additional charges. Contact and Atmosphere fields are billed at a higher
    /// rate. See the [pricing sheet](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing/sheet/)
    /// for more information. Attributions, `html_attributions`, are always
    /// returned with every call, regardless of whether the field has been
    /// requested.
    ///
    /// * Caution: Place Search requests and Place Details requests do not
    ///   return the same fields. Place Search requests return a subset of the
    ///   fields that are returned by Place Details requests. If the field you
    ///   want is not returned by Place Search, you can use Place Search to get a
    ///   `place_id`, then use that Place ID to make a Place Details request. For
    ///   more information on the fields that are unavailable in a Place Search
    ///   request, see [Places API fields
    ///   support](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-data-fields#places-api-fields-support).
    ///
    /// * Warning: If you do not specify at least one field with a request, or
    ///   if you omit the `fields` parameter from a request, ALL possible fields
    ///   will be returned, and you will be billed accordingly. This applies only
    ///   to Place Details requests.
    ///
    /// # Generics
    ///
    /// This method uses generics to improve ergonomics. The `C` generic is
    /// intended to represent any collection that can be iterated over, and the
    /// `F` generic is for any type that can be converted to the `Field` type.
