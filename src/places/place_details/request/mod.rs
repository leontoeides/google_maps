    /// Fields are divided into three billing categories: Basic, Contact, and

    /// rate. See the [pricing sheet](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing/sheet/)

    /// * See the list of supported languages. Google often updates the
    ///   supported languages, so this list may not be exhaustive.
    ///
    /// * If `language` is not supplied, the API attempts to use the preferred
    ///   language as specified in the `Accept-Language` header.
    ///
    /// * The API does its best to provide a street address that is readable for
    ///   both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street
    ///   addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable
    ///   by the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other
    ///   addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components
    ///   are all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first
    ///   component.
    ///
    /// * If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the
    ///   closest match.
    ///
    /// * The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results
    ///   that the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are
    ///   returned. The geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending
    ///   on language, such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms
    ///   that may be valid in one language but not in another. For example,
    ///   _utca_ and _t√©r_ are synonyms for street in Hungarian.

    /// with some notable exceptions. For example, the United Kingdom's ccTLD is

    /// when they select a place and a call to Place Details is made. Each

    /// API key(s) used for each request within a session must belong to the
    /// same Google Cloud Console project. Once a session has concluded, the
    /// token is no longer valid; your app must generate a fresh token for each
    /// session. If the `sessiontoken` parameter is omitted, or if you reuse a
    /// session token, the session is charged as if no session token was
    /// provided (each request is billed separately).
    ///
    /// We recommend the following guidelines:
    ///
    /// * Use session tokens for all autocomplete sessions.
    ///
    /// * Generate a fresh token for each session. Using a version 4 UUID is
    ///   recommended.
    ///
    /// * Ensure that the API key(s) used for all Place Autocomplete and Place
    ///   Details requests within a session belong to the same Cloud Console
    ///   project.

    ///   billed individually.
