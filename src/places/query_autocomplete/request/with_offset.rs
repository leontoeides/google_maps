    /// ## Arguments
    ///
    /// * `offset` â€§ The position, in the input term, of the last character that
    ///   the service uses to match predictions. For example, if the input is
    ///   `Google` and the offset is 3, the service will match on `Goo`. The
    ///   string determined by the offset is matched against the first word in
    ///   the input term only. For example, if the input term is `Google abc`
    ///   and the offset is 3, the service will attempt to match against
    ///   `Goo abc`. If no offset is supplied, the service will use the whole
    ///   term. The offset should generally be set to the position of the text
    ///   caret.
