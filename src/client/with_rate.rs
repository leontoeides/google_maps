impl crate::client::Client {
    // -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    //
    /// Sets the rate limit for the specified API.
    ///
    /// ## Arguments
    ///
    /// * `api` ‧ Which Google Maps API are you setting the rate limit for? For
    ///   example, `Api::Directions`, `Api::DistanceMatrix`, `Api::Elevation`,
    ///   `Api::Geocoding`, `Api::TimeZone`, and so on. The `Api::All` rate
    ///   limit is applied to all Google Maps API requests _in addition_ to the
    ///   per-API rate limits.
    ///
    /// * `requests` ‧ The number of requests the client library is attempting
    ///   to target. For example, _2 requests_ per 1 hour.
    ///
    /// * `duration` ‧ The duration for the targeted request rate. For example,
    ///   1 request _per 1 minute_. This can be defined using the
    ///   `std::time::Duration` methods.
    ///
    /// ## Examples:
    ///
    /// The following examples show how one might try to limit the request
    /// rate to achieve maximum throughput while minimizing charges by Google.
    ///
    /// **The following rates are subject to change by Google. Please review
    /// the current [Google Maps Platform billing
    /// rates](https://developers.google.com/maps/billing/gmp-billing).**
    ///
    /// **This Google client library's rate limiting is not persistent. If your
    /// program is often restarted, it is easily possible to exceed Google's
    /// monthly free credit. These are approximations and examples.**
    ///
    /// **To accurately minimize billing charges by Google, please use the
    /// [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
    /// _IAM & admin_ to set quotas for each API on the server's side.**
    ///
    /// You are responsible for all charges. Use with care.
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// // Assumptions:
    /// // - $200.00 USD monthly free credit from Google. Thanks, guys!
    /// // - 2,629,746 seconds in a month.
    /// const GOOGLE_CREDIT: f64 = 200.0;
