    /// ## Notes
    ///
    /// * This function does not validate the request before generating the
    ///   _query string_. However, the superior method that generates the _query
    ///   URL_ does perform validation.
    ///
    /// * The query string is the part of the URL after the `?` question mark.
    ///   For example, in the URL `https://example.com/over/there?name=ferret`
    ///   the query string is `name=ferret`
    ///
    /// * There's no benefit to working on an owned `Request` struct (i.e. an
    ///   owned `self` versus an borrowed `&self`).
    ///   [percent-encoding](https://crates.io/crates/percent-encoding)
    ///   works on borrowed UTF-8 strings. Other types, such as enums and
    ///   numeric values are converted into strings. Therefore no zero-copy
    ///   operations are possible with an owned `self`.
