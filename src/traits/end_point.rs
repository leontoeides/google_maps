/// Defines a Google Maps API HTTP end-point for a request.

/// their API end-point. It also includes some extra information for debugging
/// and rating-limiting.

///
/// * This trait should be implemented for the `Request` structure. When the
///   request structure is submitted, the end-point information will be looked
///   up from this trait.
