    /// Specify whether service may provide more than one route alternative in
    /// the response.

    /// ## Arguments
    ///
    /// * `alternatives` â€§ Whether more than one route should be in Google's
    ///   response.

    /// ## Description
    ///
    /// If set to `true`, specifies that the Directions service may provide more

    ///
    /// ## Example
    ///
    /// * Allow more than one route in the response:
    /// ```rust
    /// .with_alternatives(true)
    /// ```
