/// Each element in the `steps` array defines a single step of the calculated
/// directions. A step is the most atomic unit of a direction's route,
/// containing a single step describing a specific, single instruction on the
/// journey. E.g. "Turn left at W. 4th St." The step not only describes the
/// instruction but also contains distance and duration information relating to
/// how this step relates to the following step. For example, a step denoted as
/// "Merge onto I-80 West" may contain a duration of "37 miles" and
/// "40 minutes," indicating that the next step is 37 miles/40 minutes from this
/// step.
///
/// When using the Directions API to search for transit directions, the steps
/// array will include additional [transit
/// details](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/intro#TransitDetails)
/// in the form of a `transit_details` array. If the directions include multiple
/// modes of transportation, detailed directions will be provided for walking or
/// driving steps in an inner `steps` array. For example, a walking step will
/// include directions from the start and end locations: "Walk to Innes Ave &
/// Fitch St". That step will include detailed walking directions for that route
/// in the inner steps array, such as: "Head north-west", "Turn left onto
/// Arelious Walker", and "Turn left onto Innes Ave".
