# Installation

Configure the dependencies in your project's `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
google_maps = "3.8"
```

Optionally, add `rust_decimal = "1"` and `rust_decimal_macros = "1"` for access to the `dec!` macro. This macro can be used to define decimal numbers in your program. 

This is useful for hard-coding latitudes and longitudes into your code for testing.

## Feature Flags

The desired Google Maps APIs can be enabled individually via feature flags.

Additionally, usage of rustls for Reqwest is supported.

# Release Notes

The [full changelog is available here](https://github.com/leontoeides/google_maps/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

Releases [are available on GitHub](https://github.com/leontoeides/google_maps/releases).

# Examples

## Address Validation

The Address Validation API validates an address and its components, standardizes
the address for mailing, and determines the best known geocode for it.

```rust
use google_maps::prelude::*;

let google_maps_client = google_maps::Client::try_new("YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")?;

let postal_address = PostalAddress::builder()
    .region_code(&Country::UnitedStates)
    .address_lines(vec![
        "1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy",
        "Mountain View, CA, 94043"
    ])
    .build();

let address_validation_response = google_maps_client
    .validate_address()
    .address(postal_address)
    .build()
    .execute()
    .await?;

// Dump entire response:
println!("{address_validation_response:#?}");

// Optional feedback step. Let Google know which address was used for the
// your query:

google_maps_client
    .provide_validation_feedback()
    .conclusion(ValidationConclusion::Unused)
    .response_id(address_validation_response.response_id())
    .build()
    .execute()
    .await?;
```

## Directions API

The Directions API is a service that calculates directions between locations.
You can search for directions for several modes of transportation, including
transit, driving, walking, or cycling.

```rust
use google_maps::prelude::*;

let google_maps_client = Client::new("YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE");

// Example request:

let directions = google_maps_client.directions(
    // Origin: Canadian Museum of Nature
    Location::from_address("240 McLeod St, Ottawa, ON K2P 2R1"),
    // Destination: Canada Science and Technology Museum
    Location::try_from_f32(45.403_509, -75.618_904)?,
)
.with_travel_mode(TravelMode::Driving)
.execute()
.await?;

// Dump entire response:

println!("{:#?}", directions);
```

## Distance Matrix API

The Distance Matrix API is a service that provides travel distance and time for
a matrix of origins and destinations, based on the recommended route between
start and end points.

```rust
use google_maps::prelude::*;

let google_maps_client = Client::new("YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE");

// Example request:

let distance_matrix = google_maps_client.distance_matrix(
    // Origins
    vec![
        // Microsoft
        Waypoint::from_address("One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052, United States"),
        // Cloudflare
        Waypoint::from_address("101 Townsend St, San Francisco, CA 94107, United States"),
    ],
    // Destinations
    vec![
        // Google
        Waypoint::from_place_id("ChIJj61dQgK6j4AR4GeTYWZsKWw"),
        // Mozilla
        Waypoint::try_from_f32(37.387_316, -122.060_008)?,
    ],
).execute().await?;

// Dump entire response:

println!("{:#?}", distance_matrix);
```

## Elevation API (Positional)

The Elevation API provides elevation data for all locations on the surface of
the earth, including depth locations on the ocean floor (which return negative
values).

```rust
use google_maps::prelude::*;

let google_maps_client = Client::new("YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE");

// Example request:

let elevation = google_maps_client.elevation()
    // Denver, Colorado, the "Mile High City"
    .for_positional_request(LatLng::try_from_dec(dec!(39.739_154), dec!(-104.984_703))?)
    .execute()
    .await?;

// Dump entire response:

println!("{:#?}", elevation);

// Display all results:

if let Some(results) = &elevation.results {
    for result in results {
        println!("Elevation: {} meters", result.elevation)
    }
}
```

## Geocoding API

The Geocoding API is a service that provides geocoding and reverse geocoding of
addresses. Geocoding is the process of converting addresses (like a street
address) into geographic coordinates (like latitude and longitude), which you
can use to place markers on a map, or position the map.

```rust
use google_maps::prelude::*;

let google_maps_client = Client::new("YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE");

// Example request:

let location = google_maps_client.geocoding()
    .with_address("10 Downing Street London")
    .execute()
    .await?;

// Dump entire response:

println!("{:#?}", location);

// Print latitude & longitude coordinates:

for result in location.results {
    println!("{}", result.geometry.location)
}
```

## Reverse Geocoding API

The Geocoding API is a service that provides geocoding and reverse geocoding of
addresses. Reverse geocoding is the process of converting geographic coordinates
into a human-readable address.

```rust
use google_maps::prelude::*;

let google_maps_client = Client::new("YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE");

// Example request:

let location = google_maps_client.reverse_geocoding(
    // 10 Downing St, Westminster, London
    LatLng::try_from_dec(dec!(51.503_364), dec!(-0.127_625))?,
)
.with_result_type(PlaceType::StreetAddress)
.execute()
.await?;

// Dump entire response:

println!("{:#?}", location);

// Display all results:

for result in location.results {
    println!(
        "{}",
        result.address_components.iter()
            .map(|address_component| address_component.short_name.to_string())
            .collect::<Vec<String>>()
            .join(", ")
    );
}
```

## Time Zone API

The Time Zone API provides time offset data for locations on the surface of the
earth. You request the time zone information for a specific latitude/longitude
pair and date. The API returns the name of that time zone, the time offset from
UTC, and the daylight savings offset.

```rust
use google_maps::prelude::*;

let google_maps_client = Client::new("YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE");

// Example request:

let time_zone = google_maps_client.time_zone(
     // St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague, Czechia
     LatLng::try_from_dec(dec!(50.090_903), dec!(14.400_512))?,
     // The time right now in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)
     Utc::now()
).execute().await?;

// Dump entire response:

println!("{:#?}", time_zone);

// Usage example:

println!("Time at your computer: {}", Local::now().to_rfc2822());

if let Some(time_zone_id) = time_zone.time_zone_id {
    println!(
    	"Time in {}: {}",
        time_zone_id.name(),
        Utc::now().with_timezone(&time_zone_id).to_rfc2822()
    );
}
```

### Controlling Request Settings

The Google Maps client settings can be used to change the request rate and
automatic retry parameters.

```rust
use google_maps::prelude::*;

let google_maps_client = Client::new("YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE")
    // For all Google Maps Platform APIs, the client will limit 2 sucessful
    // requests for every 10 seconds:
    .with_rate(Api::All, 2, std::time::Duration::from_secs(10))
    // Returns the `Client` struct to the caller. This struct is used
    // to make Google Maps Platform requests.
    .build();
```

# Crate Status

This crate is maintained but frequent updates are not expected. This crate
currently implements all of the Google Maps features that most users would need.
Most updates will be for occasional dependency bumps.

# Feedback

I would like for you to be successful with your project! If this crate is not
working for you, doesn't work how you think it should, or if you have requests,
or suggestions - please [report them to
me](https://github.com/leontoeides/google_maps/issues)! I'm not always fast at
responding but I will respond. Thanks!

# Roadmap

- [ ] Track both _requests_ and request _elements_ for rate limiting.
- [ ] Convert explicit query validation to session types wherever reasonable.
- [ ] [Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro). Only
partly implemented. If you would like to have any missing pieces implemented,
please contact me.
- [ ] [Roads API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/roads/intro).
Only partly implemented. If you would like to have any missing pieces
implemented, please contact me.

# Author's Note

This crate is expected to work well and have the more important Google Maps
features implemented. It should work well because
[serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde), [simd-json](https://crates.io/crates/simd-json)
and, by default, [reqwest](https://crates.io/crates/reqwest) do most of the
heavy lifting!

I created this client library because I needed several Google Maps Platform
features for a project that I'm working on. So, I've decided to spin my library
off into a public crate. This is a very small token of gratitude and an attempt
to give back to the Rust community. I hope it saves someone out there some work.
